Build an AI-driven email sequencing system using Gemini AI that sends personalized weekly emails to users based on:

The day they signed up

The number of emails already sent

A 2-day sending interval

The day of the week (special logic for Friday / Black Friday)

A rule that value emails must come before hard-sell emails

Unique email content per user (to avoid spam filters)

Emails must address users by name

2. Core Functional Requirements
2.1 Email Sending Frequency

Emails are sent every 2 days

Day 1 (signup day) counts as the first email

Example:

Day 1 → Email 1

Day 3 → Email 2

Day 5 → Email 3

Day 7 → Email 4

2.2 Weekly Email Purpose Logic

Each week has the same marketing goal, but:

Each user receives a different email copy

Gemini AI must generate unique variations of the same intent

2.3 Email Types (Sequence Logic)

Emails follow a progressive funnel, not aggressive selling upfront.

Email Order	Email Type	Description
Email 1	Value – Welcome	Educational, helpful, onboarding
Email 2	Value	More trust-building, no selling
Email 3	Soft Sell	Gentle CTA, low pressure
Email 4	Hard Sell	Strong CTA
Email 5	Hard Sell	Strong CTA

❗ Rule:
If a user joins late in the week, they must not receive hard-sell emails before receiving at least one value email.

3. Day-of-Week Logic (Critical)
3.1 Signup Day Awareness

The system must track:

Signup date

Current weekday (Mon–Sun)

Number of emails already sent

3.2 Friday / Black Friday Rule

If an email is scheduled on a Friday, the email theme should be:

Black Friday / Promo Offer

However:

Each user must receive a different AI-generated version

Still follow the value → sell progression rule

❗ Example:

If user signs up on Friday:

They receive a value-based Black Friday email

NOT an aggressive hard sell immediately

4. Personalization Rules

Each email must:

Address the user by first name

Be written in a natural human tone

Avoid repeating:

Subject lines

Body structure

Phrases

Use semantic variation (Gemini AI handles this)

5. Anti-Spam Requirements

To reduce spam detection:

No identical emails sent to multiple users

Vary:

Subject lines

Sentence structure

CTA wording

Increase spacing (2-day interval enforced)

Avoid aggressive selling before trust is built

6. Data the Function Must Track (State Management)

Each user must have:

user_id
first_name
email
signup_date
emails_sent_count
last_email_sent_date
current_weekday
current_sequence_stage

7. Decision Logic (Simplified)
When sending an email:

Check if 2 days have passed since last email

Determine:

Day of the week

Email number in sequence

Apply rules:

Must start with value emails

Friday = Black Friday theme

No hard sell before value

Ask Gemini AI to:

Generate unique email

Match the required intent

Personalize using user’s name

Send email

Update user state

8. Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: User signs up on Tuesday

Day 1 (Tue): Value Welcome

Day 3 (Thu): Value

Day 5 (Sat): Soft Sell

Day 7 (Mon): Hard Sell

Scenario 2: User signs up on Friday

Day 1 (Fri): Value-based Black Friday email

Day 3 (Sun): Value

Day 5 (Tue): Soft Sell

Day 7 (Thu): Hard Sell

Scenario 3: User signs up on Day 4 of the week

They must receive value content first

Hard sell is delayed until later emails

9. What Gemini AI Is Responsible For

Gemini AI should:

Generate email content based on:

Email intent (value / soft sell / hard sell)

Day of week

Campaign theme (e.g., Black Friday)

Ensure no two users receive the same email

Maintain brand-safe, non-spammy language
