1. Fix Routing Issue on Login/Signup:
•	Currently, logging in or signing up shows this before directing you to the UI:
“❗ 404 Page Not Found, did you forget to add the page to the router?
•	Ensure the login and signup pages are correctly added to the app router so users can access them without errors.
2. Fix Admin Panel Detection:
•	The admin panel currently cannot detect admin users.
•	Make sure the admin detection logic correctly identifies admin users by checking the user’s role or permissions.
•	Admin users should be able to access the admin panel reliably.
3. Update Question Generation API:
•	Change the question generation logic from DeepSeek API to Gemini AI API.
•	Ensure the question generation function works without errors.
•	If there are no questions in the database, display the right message.
Currently it is display “Failed to load quiz, please try again” which is ambiguous and it is hard to tell what the problem is
Show a clearer message like:
“No questions available.”
4. Auto-Question Generation Improvements:
•	The question generation function should automatically start generating questions as soon as the app starts, until the required number of questions is reached.
•	If API tokens are depleted, the process should pause and resume automatically once tokens are available.
•	Admin can still manually generate questions via a button, but automatic generation takes priority.
•	Ensure manual generation allows generating questions on specific topics.
5. Improve Signup Authentication:
•	Restrict signup to only allow real emails.
•	Implement proper email validation to block fake or malformed email addresses.
6. Add Favicon:
•	Add a favicon to the website so it appears in the browser tab. The favicon  should  be  NurseBrace in blue and  white 
7. Change Website Font:
•	Update all fonts on the website to Poppins.
8. Provide a Summary:
•	After making all changes, list all files that were modified.
Notes for Execution:
•	Prioritize fixing routing and admin detection first.
•	Ensure the Gemini AI integration is fully functional.
•	Maintain existing functionality while adding improvements.
•	Test the app thoroughly after each change.
